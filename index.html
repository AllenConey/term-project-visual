      <h2>Starr Carter</h2>
      <p>Starr Carter is a sixteen-year-old Black teenager who navigates two very different worlds: the predominantly Black neighborhood of Garden Heights where she lives and the affluent, mostly white private school she attends. Balancing these environments forces Starr to confront questions of identity, belonging, and code-switching. Her world is further complicated by the racialized violence she witnesses, particularly the tragic death of her childhood friend Khalil, which becomes a defining moment in her life. Through this trauma, Starr begins to find her voice, understanding the power and responsibility that comes with speaking out. Guided by her family and community, she learns resilience, moral courage, and advocacy, gradually transforming grief and fear into activism. Her journey highlights the emotional, social, and psychological challenges adolescents face while showing how strength, courage, and community can empower young people to confront injustice and assert their agency in society.</p>

      <h2>Khalil</h2>
      <p>Khalil is Starr Carter’s childhood friend whose life and untimely death become the catalyst for the story’s exploration of systemic oppression and racialized violence. Though his death drives the plot, Khalil is portrayed as a complex individual with dreams, relationships, and challenges. He faces socioeconomic pressures and limited opportunities, highlighting the structural inequities affecting many young Black men. His involvement in dangerous situations is a reflection of survival rather than moral failure, illustrating the societal conditions that restrict options for marginalized youth. Through Starr’s memories, Khalil is remembered as loyal, protective, and human, with ambitions and emotions that make his death all the more tragic. The aftermath of his death exposes societal and media attempts to distort his story, criminalizing victims rather than acknowledging their humanity. Khalil’s memory fuels Starr’s activism and resilience, demonstrating the importance of storytelling in reclaiming dignity and inspiring social change.</p>
