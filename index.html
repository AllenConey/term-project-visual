<h2>Starr Carter</h2>
<p>Starr Carter is a 16-year-old navigating the challenges of living between two worlds: the predominantly Black neighborhood of Garden Heights and the wealthy, mostly white private school she attends. This duality creates internal conflict as she works to maintain separate identities depending on her environment. Starr’s struggle with code-switching reflects larger themes of belonging, identity formation, and social pressure placed on Black adolescents growing up in racially stratified systems.</p>
<p>Witnessing Khalil’s death at the hands of law enforcement becomes a defining trauma that forces Starr into the center of a national conversation she never asked to be part of. Her grief, fear, and confusion highlight the psychological toll placed on young people who experience racialized violence firsthand. Yet through this trauma, Starr begins to understand the power of her voice and the responsibility that comes with being a witness.</p>
<p>Throughout the novel, Starr gradually finds strength through family, community, and self-reflection. Her father Maverick teaches her the value of standing firm in truth, while her mother emphasizes safety and emotional grounding. This balance of guidance helps Starr navigate difficult choices and define her own sense of justice and courage.</p>
<p>By the end of her journey, Starr transforms from someone afraid to speak out into a young activist who channels her pain into organized resistance. Her development embodies hope and resilience—two core themes of the novel—and illustrates how adolescents can emerge from trauma with a stronger understanding of themselves and their role in the world.</p>

<h2>Khalil</h2>
<p>Khalil represents the countless young Black lives affected by systemic injustice. Although his death is a central plot catalyst, Angie Thomas ensures Khalil is more than a symbol—he is a fully realized character with dreams, vulnerabilities, and humanity. Through Starr’s memories, we see a boy who cared for his family, protected his friends, and tried to navigate limited opportunities in a world stacked against him.</p>
<p>Before his death, Khalil faced immense pressure to provide for his family, highlighting the socioeconomic challenges faced by many Black youth. His involvement in drug dealing is portrayed not as a moral failing, but as a survival strategy within a system offering few alternatives. This nuance pushes readers to confront the ways poverty, policing, and racial bias create cycles of vulnerability.</p>
<p>After his death, Khalil becomes the subject of media distortion, with news outlets framing him as a threat rather than a victim. This deliberate narrative manipulation reflects real-world patterns in which Black victims are criminalized to justify state violence. Through Starr’s insistence on telling the truth about who Khalil really was, the novel exposes the power of storytelling in reclaiming stolen dignity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Khalil’s character serves as a reminder that behind every headline is a life interrupted, a community grieving, and a society in need of change. His memory propels Starr’s transformation and anchors the novel’s call for justice, humanity, and systemic reform.</p>
