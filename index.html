      <h2>Starr Carter</h2>
      <p>Starr Carter is a sixteen-year-old Black teenager who lives at the intersection of two very different worlds, her predominantly Black neighborhood of Garden Heights and the affluent, mostly white private school she attends. This duality forces her to navigate complex issues of identity, code-switching, and belonging as she learns to balance her home life with her experiences outside the community she calls home. Starr faces the challenges of adolescence while carrying the weight of racialized violence and systemic injustice, which becomes even more personal after witnessing the tragic death of her childhood friend Khalil. Through this trauma, Starr gradually learns to find her voice and use it to speak out against injustice, both for herself and for her community. Her journey highlights resilience, moral courage, and the process of coming of age under extraordinary circumstances, showing how a young person can transform grief and fear into activism, advocacy, and a deeper understanding of her own identity and power in a society shaped by inequality.</p>

      <h2>Khalil</h2>
      <p>Khalil is Starr Carter’s childhood friend whose life and untimely death serve as the catalyst for the story’s exploration of systemic injustice and racialized violence. Though his death is a central event, Khalil is portrayed as a fully realized character with dreams, emotions, and a deep connection to his family and friends. His involvement in difficult circumstances, including navigating limited opportunities and socioeconomic pressure, illustrates the structural inequalities faced by many young Black men. Through Starr’s memories, readers see a young man who was loyal, protective, and deeply human, whose life is abruptly ended by forces beyond his control. The aftermath of his death exposes the ways in which the media and society distort the narratives of Black victims, attempting to criminalize rather than mourn them. Khalil’s story drives Starr’s awakening to the realities of systemic oppression, and his memory fuels her determination to advocate for justice, resilience, and societal change, leaving an enduring impact on those who knew him and on the readers who witness his story.</p>

      <h2>Maverick Carter</h2>
      <p>Maverick Carter, Starr’s father, serves as a pillar of strength, guidance, and moral clarity throughout the novel. As a parent and community member, he teaches Starr the importance of courage, integrity, and standing up for what is right, even when facing adversity or danger. Maverick’s experiences with systemic oppression, past mistakes, and life in a racially stratified society provide him with a perspective that he uses to guide his children, helping Starr understand the importance of self-respect, resilience, and community responsibility. He emphasizes the need to maintain moral principles while navigating a world that often challenges and undermines Black lives. His mentorship is central to Starr’s personal growth, shaping her understanding of justice, leadership, and advocacy. Maverick’s character embodies the strength of family and community, showing that guidance, love, and ethical grounding are essential for young people to face societal pressures, find their voice, and transform personal and collective challenges into opportunities for meaningful action and change.</p>

    <h2>Critical Lens Analysis</h2>
    <p>This website applies a Critical Race and Adolescent Experience lens to examine Starr’s journey throughout the novel. It highlights how systemic inequities and racialized violence influence her development while showing the importance of resilience, family, and community in shaping her sense of self. Starr’s growth demonstrates how young people can confront trauma, process grief, and transform difficult experiences into purposeful activism. Her story emphasizes the challenges faced by adolescents navigating complex social systems and the moral courage that emerges when individuals confront injustice directly. Through Starr’s perspective, readers witness the emotional, psychological, and social impacts of growing up in a society shaped by racial disparities and systemic oppression.</p>
    <p>The Adolescent Experience lens also reveals how Starr navigates the demands of multiple identities in different settings, including her neighborhood, school, and social circles. Her choices reflect the pressures of adolescence while underscoring the development of agency and self-awareness in the face of injustice. By combining themes of hope, resilience, and Critical Race Theory, this website demonstrates that even within oppressive systems, young people can find their voice, assert their agency, and work toward meaningful change. The interactive design, imagery, and layout further support this exploration by visually representing Starr’s journey and the broader societal issues presented in the novel.</p>
