      <h2>Inciting Event</h2>
      <p>Starr witnesses the sudden and tragic death of her childhood friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer, an event that changes the course of her life and forces her into an uncomfortable public spotlight. This moment is both traumatic and transformative as it confronts her with the harsh realities of systemic injustice and racialized violence in her community. It is not only a deeply personal loss but also a social awakening, compelling her to navigate the complicated emotions of grief, fear, and anger. Starr begins to recognize the power of her voice and the responsibility that comes with witnessing such an event. This experience also highlights the fragility of life in environments where racial bias and inequality dominate daily interactions, making it clear to Starr that her actions and choices moving forward will carry significance for both herself and the broader community that seeks justice for Khalil.</p>

      <h2>Conflict</h2>
      <p>Following Khalil’s death, Starr finds herself caught in a maelstrom of public attention, media coverage, and community tension. She is scrutinized for her words, her actions, and even the way she presents herself, revealing the pressures placed on young people who are forced to navigate systems that are not designed to protect or uplift them. Starr must contend with the conflicting expectations of her school, her family, and her neighborhood, each with its own perspective on how she should respond. The public narratives often misrepresent the truth, framing Khalil in ways that distort his character and shift blame onto victims rather than addressing systemic injustice. Starr experiences confusion, fear, and frustration, and she must decide whether to stay silent to avoid confrontation or speak out to assert the truth. This conflict challenges her understanding of justice, courage, and responsibility, and pushes her toward critical reflection on how she will engage with activism and social change.</p>

      <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
      <p>After facing public scrutiny and the pressures of her community, Starr enters a period of intense self-reflection, where she questions her identity, her values, and her role in activism. She must navigate the complex dynamics of living in two different worlds, balancing her life in her predominantly Black neighborhood with her experiences in her mostly white private school. This dual existence challenges Starr to consider how she presents herself, how much of her voice she can safely express, and what it means to stand up for justice. Through reflection, she begins to explore her personal moral code, understanding what she believes in and how she wants to contribute to her community. This process allows Starr to confront fear and uncertainty while building inner strength and self-awareness. Her journey of self-reflection becomes a turning point in understanding the power of personal narrative and the responsibility to act in ways that honor both her friend Khalil’s memory and her own values.</p>
