<p>Khalil Harris, though present for only a portion of the novel, represents a central emotional and political anchor in Starr’s narrative. His character is intentionally multifaceted—Thomas gives us glimpses of Khalil as a loyal friend, a protective figure, and a young man carrying the weight of systemic oppression. His death is not simply a plot device; it serves as a powerful critique of how society reduces Black youth to stereotypes, often ignoring the humanity, dreams, and complexity of their lived experiences.</p>
<p>Through Starr’s memories, we learn about Khalil’s struggles and choices, many of which stem from economic hardship and lack of opportunities. Thomas shows how systemic pressures—poverty, limited mobility, and the influence of neighborhood power structures—shape the decisions young people make. Khalil becomes a symbol of how marginalized youth are failed by institutions that are supposed to protect and uplift them. This aligns with the Critical Race Theory lens by revealing the racialized patterns that govern policing, poverty, and public perception.</p>
<p>Khalil’s death also becomes the catalyst for Starr’s internal transformation. His absence forces her to confront her own fears and question the systems that allow such injustices to occur repeatedly. In this sense, Khalil’s character remains fully present throughout the novel, shaping Starr’s actions, her understanding of justice, and her sense of responsibility to speak the truth others want erased.</p>
<p>Thematically, Khalil embodies the tragedy of lost potential but also the spark of collective uprising. The protests, media coverage, and community reactions following his death highlight the complexity of public grief in marginalized communities. Through Khalil, Thomas forces readers to confront how society values—or devalues—Black youth and challenges the audience to rethink narratives around victimhood, innocence, and justice.</p>

<div id="maverickPopup" class="popup"><div class="popup-content"><span class="close" onclick="closePopup('maverickPopup')">&times;</span><h2>Maverick Carter</h2>
<p>Maverick Carter stands as one of the most influential forces in Starr’s life and serves as a model of Black fatherhood rarely portrayed in mainstream media. A former gang member who rebuilt his life through discipline, loyalty, and a deep dedication to his family, Maverick represents the possibility of change even within environments shaped by structural inequality. His character highlights the complexities of masculinity, responsibility, and redemption in communities affected by poverty and surveillance.</p>
<p>Throughout the novel, Maverick acts as Starr’s moral compass. He teaches her the importance of speaking truth and standing firm in her identity—even when the world attempts to diminish or distort it. His lessons on Black pride, safety, and communal responsibility are central to Starr’s development. These moments reflect the intergenerational transmission of resilience in Black families, emphasizing the power of cultural knowledge as a tool of survival and empowerment.</p>
<p>Maverick’s past also reveals the systemic forces that shape the lives of young Black men. His earlier involvement with the King Lords was not born from desire but necessity. By depicting his transition from gang life to devoted fatherhood and business owner, Thomas critiques the limited pathways available to Black youth while also highlighting the strength it takes to escape cycles of violence and incarceration.</p>
<p>In Starr’s journey, Maverick represents stability, wisdom, and love. His role underscores the YA theme of community as a foundation for hope. Maverick’s unwavering support empowers Starr to speak out publicly and embrace her voice. His character ultimately embodies resilience—showing how personal transformation can spark change within families and entire communities.</p>
